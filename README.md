# p4a_helloworld
A working example for how to build an APK with flask and pythonforandroid or buildozer.

Notes.

Buildozer docs.
https://buildozer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html

Buildozer did produce an APK that I did install but the "app" doesn't stay up, the screen flickers once and the app closes again. Maybe that's intended behavior as in the app launches, executes run for a tick, "finishes" and exits or something.

I don't know how to access or find logs for this.

python for android
https://python-for-android.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

I did not manage to complete a build with pythonforandroid.

Although there are technically instructions on how to do it:
https://python-for-android.readthedocs.io/en/latest/quickstart/?highlight=flask#build-a-webview-application

It... didn't work. Hopefully with your help I can manage to make it work and we can improve the docs.
